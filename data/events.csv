Having lived in Missoula with his wife and son for the last 22 years, Neil says he still misses the opportunity to photograph professional ballet companies.</p> <p>When he heard the news in early 2009 that the Moscow Ballet was visiting Montana, he jumped at the chance to photograph them behind the scenes.

This is a juried collection of color and black &amp; white photographs dedicated to the memory of long-time member Dick Loepp.</p> <p>The Fine Grain Photography Group has been in existence for over thirty years and is an association of local enthusiasts. It was first organized in the late 1970s by six students of accomplished photographer, the late Lee Nye, while he was teaching a series of photography courses at the University of Montana. Nye was the inspiration for founding the Fine Grain Group and served as mentor until 1991, when he became unable to continue due to ill health. RMSP founder/owner Neil Chaput de Saintonge then assumed the role of mentor and group leader in 1991, and for twenty years has provided advice, support, friendship and critical but constructive critiques of their monthly photography assignments.</p> <p><i>Cityscapes and Landscapes</i> will open Friday, April 1, 2011 at Rocky Mountain School of Photography Gallery located at 216 N. Higgins Avenue in downtown Missoula. Some of the artists will be present at the opening, which runs from 5 to 8 p.m. </p> <p>The show runs an entire month so if you can't make it to the opening please stop by during normal gallery hours/days.

Photograph subjects that start with the letter “D”, and bring your favorites to the May 12th meeting. Yellowstone Photo had an opening for a First Friday display on July 1st, so I grabbed it for the club. We talked about picking a theme in advance, and then photographing for that theme. One theme suggestion was Freedom. We’ll make a final decision during the business meeting portion of next month’s meeting, so come prepared with other ideas if you don’t like the Freedom theme. Also start thinking about any extracurricular field trips you’d like to take as a club this year. Debbe will bring the planning calendar next month that we have used in years past to get us started.</p>"

Great news, great ideas.</p> <p>We will have 3 floors in which to exhibit. Suggested that each Photog have a space to display just their art. Each photog to create a Bio (with pic) about them/their art. Surprise! We may have large screen TV's for slideshows! So we can talk about that during Pub Crawl or on the 18th. Vann's has agreed to loan us large screen TV's and players.<br/>Lots of publicity. Plus we can go viral on this ourselves. May have a large turnout by residents to have their pictures taken on the 18th (May).<br/>We can get in as early as we want on the 9th of June to set up. We also need folks to help tear down on the 19 or 20th. Asked if we would charge residents if they want their photos. Suggested they pay for printing, may just send them to the print shop when we get a shop to donate for the show. Start looking for pictures of a Father's Day theme (any) and Montana based photos of Logging, Fly-fishing, wildlife, 'scapes all based in Montana.<br/>More....this is going to be huge!

Stephanie Foster just contacted us (via Rocky Mountain School of Photography) about our group having a showing at Grizzly Peak Retirement Community in Missoula. The dates of the show June 10th through the 19th. With an open house on the 11th.</p> <p>Of course the show will be open to the public on all dates and not just the open house. What a great opportunity to have your talents and artwork shown to the public! Some things we get to decide: Do we want to do it?</p> <p>If so, meet on the 18th of May at Grizzly Peak Retirement Community for either a 5pm dinner with the residents to get ideas on what photo types they would like and possibly take pictures of them (theme related-Fathers day) Or Meet at 7pm (same date) to walk through the area for display to get ideas on sizing of photos, etc.</p> <p>Also, shall we set up the show Thursday night or Friday-daytime? Please reply at the bottom of this post (or on the poll if it works or both) so we can get a general consensus. I realize that putting a show together this fast is challenging and fun.</p> <p>Please reply ASAP so we can organize all the bits. All votes will be tallied and the group decisions will be announced on Wednesday (here) the 11th. In the event of a tie, Scott or I will make a decision as a tie breaker.</p> <p>If you have a collection of Fathers Day type shots, cool. If you want to take people pictures of the residents (with the residents permission), cool. If neither than when we meet we can get a better idea of the genres each will provide and how many.</p> <p>What a great group event! If we decide to do this then I will also contact printing shops locally to see if they will donate with us to do the printing, framing, etc. Okay quick at it then, decide, post your answers and we’re off!</p>"

See you out and about ---debbe</p> <p>



From Peter:</p> <p>What makes a well-balanced photograph? Warm foregrounds can balance cool backgrounds. One large building on the left can balance three smaller ones on the right. A smaller amount of bright blue sky can balance a larger amount of dark green forest. Size, shape, color, symmetry, even emotional value – we can all think of concepts that affect visual balance in a photo. For your assignment, bring 3-5 photos that you feel are visually balanced in some way, and why you think they are balanced. We’ll spend a little more time with each photo next month talking about balance.</p> <p>

I’ve included three sources for reference material in case you’re interested. The first is a video tutorial specifically about shooting wide scenic landscapes that discusses other concepts as well as balance, but a lot of the concepts apply to other types of photography as well. The other two references are just sites I Googled that define and give a few examples of visual balance. See you next month!</p> <p><a href=""http://www.tmelive.com/Features/FoundationConcepts/2010/August/BasicCompositionConceptsGrandScale/BasicCompositionConceptsGrandScale.html""> <a href=""http://www.tmelive.com/Features/FoundationConcepts/2010/August/BasicCompositionConceptsGrandScale/BasicCompositionConceptsGrandScale.html"" class=""linkified"">http://www.tmelive.com/Features/FoundationConcepts/2010/August/BasicCompositionConceptsGrandScale/BasicCompositionConceptsGrandScale.html</a></a></p> <p><a href=""http://www.sallygentieuwelch.com/pages/balance2.html""> <a href=""http://www.sallygentieuwelch.com/pages/balance2.html"" class=""linkified"">http://www.sallygentieuwelch.com/pages/balance2.html</a></a></p> <p><a href=""http://www.neurosoftware.ro/programming-blog/facebook-web-design/web-design/19-factors-that-impact-compositional-balance/""> <a href=""http://www.neurosoftware.ro/programming-blog/facebook-web-design/web-design/19-factors-that-impact-compositional-balance/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.neurosoftware.ro/programming-blog/facebook-web-design/web-design/19-factors-that-impact-compositional-balance/</a></a></p> <p><br/>--------------------------------<br/>Peter Tucker</p> <p>""</p>"

They last longer and will help you avoid short battery life during this event. TRIPOD and/or Mono pod. You may also be doing a lot of hand held's/run-N-gun shots.. A backup device like a portable Hard drive or a laptop so you can dump your cards in case you don't have a lot of spares. Water bottle as you may not have time to teak a break. Any props (hats, scarves, whatever) you feel may be used in spicing up your shots/models. Hopefully we will also have a green screen to shoot off of so keep that in mind when thinking of the types of backgrounds you may be substituting behind the models. <b>Let's have a blast!</b></p> <p> </p> <p><b>Below are some links to Youtube Videos you may want to watch in advance at your leisure.

Data access through OR/Ms is nearly always a love-hate relationship, and usually involves turning over a lot of trust and control to a black box like Entity Framework or NHibernate. Massive is appealing because it is extremely thin and lightweight; it’s a single file that contains only 524 lines of code. It also represents a recent trend of moving away from abstracting data access code and writing queries directly in SQL. This talk will give an introduction to Massive while exploring the practical aspects of introducing a micro OR/M and Dynamics into a legacy enterprise application.</p> <p><i>About Ken</i></p> <p><a href=""http://twitter.com/kenswdev"">Ken Turley</a> is Sr. Developer at ELM Locating &amp; Utility services in Missoula.

Weather predictions are cloudy and the moonrise 'guestimate' is for approx 8:52 PM. This is when the moon is at it's closest to the Earth and is up to (visually) 13% larger. The greatest magnification of the Moon happens on the horizon.</p> <p>Suggested that one gets out before the moonrise and pre visualize the horizon with the moon rising...we only have a few minutes to actually 'get' the shot.</p> <p>Keep in mind that if one is in a valley, moonrise can be 'up to' an hour after estimated 'rise' times. So if one wanted to, one could take a first series from a very high vantage point (ex: High up on the 'M' ) and then dash down to the valley and take a second series.</p> <p>A great point Peter Dove made, using the idea above, the first series you make from up high will have the sun setting at the same time so landscape/moon photos will have an illuminated landscape. Second series (from the valley floor) will more than likely be silhouetted landscapes with the brighter full moon and no fill light from the sun.</p> <p> </p> <p><a href=""http://www.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/findweather/getForecast?query=46.91611099,-114.09055328""><b>Check local weather here.</b></a></p> <p><a href=""http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/47235294/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/thats-not-just-full-moon-week-its-supermoon/#.T59H7NWJl8E""><b>Read more about the Super Moon here.</b></a></p> <p><a href=""http://photonaturalist.net/biggest-full-moon-of-the-year-occurs-this-saturday/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+photonaturalist+%28PhotoNaturalist%29"">A great page to visit on the subject submitted by Ken Stolz:</a></p> <p>Want a lot more precise planning for any Moon-Sun events anywhere in the world-any day/night?

"100349082","Billings: Distributed Version Control (Mercurial / Git)",1360198800000,-25200000,1328524,11348682,"past","<p>At AWG: Park on 3rd Ave between 11th and 12th St.</p> <p> </p> <p>Shawn Wilson will be presenting on distributed version control using Mercurial as an example and John Clayton will demonstrate his experience with Git. This presentation will cover some history of version control and the main features of a distributed version control system. You will learn the version control lingo such as committing, diffs, branching, and merging and see how these feats are accomplished using Git, Mercurial, and Meld, open-source programs that are available on Windows and Linux.</p> <p>A Brief History of Version Control...</p> <p>Version Control refers to a class of tools that allow a person to track changes in their files and to merge in changes to the same files made by others. These tools allow you to easily roll back to a previous edit if there is a problem after you have already saved your changes. They will usually keep track of only the changed portions of a file and then reconstruct the entire file as needed in order to save space (as opposed to storing a complete copy of the file for every little change).</p> <p>In the beginning there were the local tools such as RCS (Revision Control System) and early VSS (Microsoft Visual SourceSafe) which allowed you to track changes on your local machine but were difficult to share with others. Then came the client-server tools such as CVS (Concurrent Versions System) and a new VSS that ran on a server, allowing any number of users to contribute to the same set of files. SVN (Subversion) improved the experience by supporting atomic commits (where changes to multiple files are tracked as a single operation) and gracefully handling files that are renamed or copied.</p> <p>Today, we have a number of true distributed version control systems available, such as Mercurial and Git. In the distributed model, changes are committed to a local repository and then this repository is shared between users as a separate step. With these systems there is no requirement to set up a server, though it is often beneficial to designate an ""authoritative"" master repository that is generally hosted on a server.</p> <p>Mercurial and Git are two of the more popular open-source distributed version control systems in use today.</p> <p> </p>"

He will also address some of the major scientific developments and the mutual interfaces of photography and technology, each of which influenced the other, as well as some of the iconic photographers and how they influenced our understanding of art and our world; names such as Steichen, Strand, Adams, Weston and W. Eugene Smith.</p> <p>Herbert Swick has enjoyed photography as a serious hobby for over 40 years, during which time he has become fascinated by the history of photography.

The only materials required (if you wanted to participate and follow along line by line) would be a machine that can run Visual Studio 2013 and a GitHub + CodeEval account (I recommend signing up for GitHub because CodeEval uses GitHub's OpenId system and we'll use GitHub further down the road anyway).

That way you can catch a dozen or more views of different targets, instead of just one. There are a limited number of spots available, so to reserve your free tickets, check out the university's informational pages here:</p> <p>How to get tickets (free!): <a href=""http://cas.umt.edu/physics/Blue_Mountain_Observatory/summer-observation.php"" class=""linkified"">http://cas.umt.edu/physics/Blue_Mountain_Observatory/summer-observation.php</a></p> <p>The observatory: <a href=""http://cas.umt.edu/physics/Blue_Mountain_Observatory/default.php"" class=""linkified"">http://cas.umt.edu/physics/Blue_Mountain_Observatory/default.php</a></p> <p>Keep in mind it's about a 45-minute drive up the mountain, and there is not much space for parking, so it's best to carpool.

What we have now is a self-driving RC car kit with an Arduino micro-controller (a clone, actually) on-board with a multitude of sensors integrated. Then a WiFi chip was connected so we could gather data and issue commands sans wires (RC aka ""remote""-controlled). Eric bravely suffered through many tutorials on Unity3D so that we could have a visual interface.</p> <p>Now, in Unity3D, we have live sensor readouts, manual drive controls, and an auto-drive / collision-avoidance mode. Though currently running on a PC, this theoretically means it should be trivial to target Android or iOS as well.</p> <p>We also have a mobile application to control the device via Bluetooth. This application was designed using MIT's App Inventor and is pretty straightforward, letting the user configure wireless network settings before communications to Unity3D are opened. This app also provides manual drive functions.</p> <p>For this presentation we will provide a high-level overview of the components and technologies used and demonstrate the working prototype. Based on audience interest we could end up going far down the rabbit hole into the nitty-gritty details and source code. There has been some demand for Arduino- or Unity3D-focused sessions here in Billings so it is our intention that this presentation will spur interest in future in-depth discussions.</p> <p>
