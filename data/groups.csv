<p>This is a group for those who enjoy backpacking and sharing this passion with others.&nbsp; These <b>backpacking trips</b> can be anything from a couple miles into an alpine lake to a multi-day loop.</p>
<p>The trips will require backpacks, tents, sleeping bags and other gear/food you need to keep fed, warm, and dry.&nbsp; This group practices Leave No Trace along with trying to leave the areas better than we found it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Each individual is responsible for their own safety and to come equipped with the proper items for a successful trip.</p>
<p>Trail trained dogs are permitted on most trips.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This group is not only for seasoned backpackers but for those who have an interest in learning more.&nbsp; Along with the backpacking trips there will also be gatherings (at a brewery or distillery).&nbsp; This will be a great opportunity for everyone to socialize and meet before embarking on a trip.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Above all, this is a group of like-minded individuals that are here to have an enjoyable time.&nbsp; We have two rules. &nbsp;The first is&nbsp;<b>Respect</b>.&nbsp; Respect for one another along with respect for Mother Nature.&nbsp; Failure to follow this rule will get you banned from the group. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The second rule is to <b>Hike Your Hike</b>. &nbsp;Meaning that these events are during your free time and for your enjoyment. &nbsp;If your hike involves photography then feel free to stop as often as you like. &nbsp;If you want to pull off and fish a lake on the way, then feel free. &nbsp;If you hike a faster pace then do not let us slow you down. &nbsp;We are all adults and will reassemble at designated locations.</p>
